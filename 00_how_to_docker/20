# Create a local swarm, the Char virtual machine should be its manager

docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip Char)

# A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or
# virtual machines that are running the Docker application
# and that have been configured to join together in a cluster.

# This allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines.

# One of the key advantages of swarm services over standalone containers is
# that you can modify a serviceâ€™s configuration, including the networks and
# volumes it is connected to, without the need to manually restart the service.
